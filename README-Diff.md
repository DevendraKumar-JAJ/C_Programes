# Student Marks Comparator 📚

A simple C program to find the maximum marks scored by a student in a class.

## Features 🤔
- Asks for the number of students in the class
- Prompts the user to enter marks for each student
- Finds the maximum marks scored by a student
- Displays the maximum marks and the student number

## How to Use 📄
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC)
2. Run the program
3. Enter the number of students in the class
4. Enter the marks for each student
5. The program will display the maximum marks and the student number

## Code Explanation 💻
The program uses a simple loop to iterate through each student's marks, keeping track of the maximum marks found so far. The student number is also stored and displayed along with the maximum marks.

## Notes 📝
- The program assumes that student numbers start from 1.
- The program uses a fixed-size array to store the marks, so it may not work for very large class sizes.
